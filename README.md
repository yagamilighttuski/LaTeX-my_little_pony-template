# LaTeX-my_little_pony-template
Since I'm a big fan of My Little Pony, I created this LaTeX template. I wish to convey my passion through this, and also hope it can assist those who need it.
(P.S. .aux, .gz and .log files are not important. You probably don't need to download them. The really useful files for you are .tex files (allowing you to compile and modify by yourself, and add new features) and .pdf files (allowing you to preview to ensure it is the template you want). I put .aux, .gz and .log files here to ensure the integrity of information, just in case someone needs them.)
# LaTeX environment
1. You should have TeXlive or other TeX distributions on your computer, and the environment variables are set up properly, so you can run .tex file normally.
2. If you meet the above conditions, you can download mlp_random_single.tex, mlp_six_in_row.tex and mlp_two_paired.tex and run them (of course, you can also preview the PDF effects first). Make sure demo_image, my_little_pony_icon5, pony1, ... pony6 and the above three .tex files are in the same folder. For example, you can create a folder D:\my_little_pony_template. In this folder, there are three .tex files and the image files mentioned above. In this way, you should be able to compile the same results as me. If you want to change the images, just replace demo_image, my_little_pony_icon5 and other image files. 
# Description about the three .tex files
These three files are three versions with different effects, but the differences between them are actually very small. Their effects are as described in the file names. mlp_random_single.tex randomly adds one of pony1 to pony6 in the lower right corner of each page. mlp_six_in_row.tex adds six ponies in a line to the lower right corner of each page. mlp_two_paired.tex randomly selects two from the six ponies to form a pair for combination (CP fans will be overjoyed :) ).
# My Little Pony
Have fun, and friendship is magic yay~.
